This is a python utility designed to remove frames from a PCAP file for anonymization. this project was created to serve a need for PCAP analysis at DreamPort. The more realistic PCAP we study the better off we are HOWEVER we must ensure not to reveal personally or professionally identifiable information from the environment where we gathered our data in the first place.
